# Ishankit-Patil-Project-on-HR-Analytices-To-Track-Employee-Performance.
Project Overview:
This project aims to build a simple HR analytics dashboard to track employee performance. The goal is to use data-driven insights to monitor employee performance metrics such as productivity, attendance, engagement, and overall contribution to the companyâ€™s success. This mini-project will help HR managers make data-backed decisions for performance reviews, training needs, and talent development.
Step 1: Data Collection
Collect data from various HR systems (e.g., attendance records, performance reviews, employee surveys). The data might include:

Employee Information: Name, department, position, years in service, age, etc.
Performance Data: Performance review scores (monthly/quarterly), task completion rates, KPIs.
Attendance Data: Absenteeism, tardiness, and leave records.
Engagement Data: Survey responses, employee feedback, training participation.
Step 2: Define Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The KPIs will help measure and track employee performance. Some useful KPIs could be:

Review Score: A numeric score from performance reviews, typically from 1 to 5.
Attendance Rate: The percentage of days present vs. total working days.
Task Completion Rate: The percentage of tasks completed by an employee.
Engagement Score: A score from employee surveys measuring engagement and satisfaction.
Training Hours: The number of hours an employee has spent on training and development programs.
Step 3: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Data cleaning is crucial to ensure that the data is accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis. This might involve:

Removing duplicate rows.
Handling missing or incomplete data.
Converting data types (e.g., converting dates to date format, scores to numerical values).
Normalizing or standardizing some variables (e.g., Attendance rate, Performance score).
For example, to calculate the attendance rate:
Step 4: Analysis
Once the data is cleaned, perform the following types of analysis:

Descriptive Statistics:

Calculate average performance scores, attendance rates, and engagement scores across the organization.
Identify top performers, underperformers, and trends (e.g., departments with higher engagement scores).
Correlations:

Check for correlations between KPIs (e.g., Do higher attendance rates correlate with higher performance scores?).
Segmentation:

Segment employees by department, role, or tenure to understand how different groups perform.
Step 5: Visualization
Use a dashboard tool like Tableau or Power BI to visualize the analysis. Some useful visualizations include:

Bar Charts for performance distribution (e.g., performance scores by department).
Heatmaps for correlation analysis (e.g., comparing attendance and performance scores).
Line Graphs for trends over time (e.g., performance reviews over several months).
Pie Charts for segmenting data (e.g., task completion by department).
tep 6: Insights and Reporting
From the analysis and visualizations, generate insights and recommendations. For example:

Insight 1: Employees with higher attendance rates tend to have better performance scores.
Insight 2: The IT department has lower engagement scores, indicating a need for targeted employee engagement strategies.
Insight 3: Employees with more training hours show higher task completion rates, suggesting that further training can boost performance.
Step 7: Conclusion and Recommendations
Based on the data analysis and visualizations, HR teams can take the following actions:

Identify top performers for promotion or rewards.
Provide additional training for employees with lower task completion rates or performance scores.
Implement employee engagement initiatives for departments with low engagement scores.
Monitor absenteeism and improve attendance rates by introducing wellness programs.
